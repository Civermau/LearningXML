XML Document Structure:
  The XML document is represented by the XmlDocument class in C#.
  It provides methods and properties for creating, loading, manipulating, and saving XML data.

Creating the XML Document:
  A new XML document is created using the XmlDocument class.
  The CreateElement method is used to create elements within the document.
  The AppendChild method is used to add child elements to the document.
  The root element named "Libros" is created and appended to the document.

Adding Attribute and Elements to the XML Document:
  New elements are added to the XML document using the CreateElement method of the XmlDocument class.
  The CreateAttribute method is used to create an attribute for a specific element.
  The Value property of the XmlAttribute object is set to the desired value.
  The new elements and attributes are appended to their respective parent elements using the AppendChild method.

Saving the XML Document:
  The Save method of the XmlDocument class is used to save the XML document to a file.
  It takes the file path as a parameter and overwrites the existing file with the updated XML data.

Loading the XML Document and Accessing Elements:
  The Load method of the XmlDocument class is used to load an XML document from a file.
  The DocumentElement property of the XmlDocument object is used to get the root element of the XML document.
  The SelectSingleNode method of the XmlNode class is used to select a single node that matches a given XPath expression.

Reading Node Values:
  The InnerText property of an XmlNode object is used to retrieve the text content of a specific node.
  It returns the concatenated values of all the immediate child nodes' text content.

Modifying Values in the XML Document:
  The value of a specific node in the XML document is modified by selecting the node and updating its InnerText property.
