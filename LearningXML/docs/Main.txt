Main Method:
  The Main method serves as the entry point for the program execution.
  It contains a loop that presents a menu of options to the user until the "Exit" option is selected.
  The loop is controlled by the boolean variable exit.

Menu Options:
  The user is presented with a menu of options using the Console.WriteLine method.
  The user's input is obtained using the Console.ReadLine method.

Option 1: CRUD:
  If the user selects option 1, the CRUD.CRUDMain() method is called.
  This method is expected to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Option 2: XML Example:
  If the user selects option 2, the Books.SaveLogics() method is called.
  This method is expected to demonstrate XML-related operations using an example scenario.

Option 9: Exit:
  If the user selects option 9, the exit variable is set to true, terminating the loop and exiting the program.
