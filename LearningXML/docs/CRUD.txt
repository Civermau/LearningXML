XML Document Structure:
  The XML document is represented by the XmlDocument class in C#.
  It provides methods and properties for creating, loading, manipulating, and saving XML data.

Creating the XML Document:
  If the XML file doesn't exist, a new XML document is created using the XmlDocument class.
  The CreateElement method is used to create elements within the document.
  The AppendChild method is used to add child elements to the document.
  The CreateElement method creates the root element named "Elements" and appends it to the document.

Loading the XML Document:
  The XML document is loaded using the Load method of the XmlDocument class.
  The Load method reads the XML data from the file and creates an in-memory representation of the XML structure.

Selecting Nodes with XPath:
  XPath is used to query and select specific nodes in the XML document.
  The SelectNodes method of the XmlNodeList class is used to select multiple nodes that match a given XPath expression.
  The SelectSingleNode method of the XmlNode class is used to select a single node that matches a given XPath expression.

Reading Node Values:
  The InnerText property of an XmlNode object is used to retrieve the text content of a specific node.
  It returns the concatenated values of all the immediate child nodes' text content.

Adding Elements to the XML Document:
  New elements are added to the XML document using the CreateElement method of the XmlDocument class.
  The CreateElement method creates a new XmlElement object with the specified name.
  The InnerText property of the XmlElement object is set to the desired value.
  The new element is appended to the parent element using the AppendChild method.

Updating Elements in the XML Document:
  The SelectSingleNode method is used to find the specific element to update based on its ID attribute.
  The InnerText property of the selected XmlNode object is updated with the new value.

Removing Elements from the XML Document:
  The SelectSingleNode method is used to find the specific element to delete based on its ID attribute.
  The RemoveChild method is called on the parent node to remove the selected element from the XML structure.

Saving Changes to the XML Document:
  The Save method of the XmlDocument class is used to save the modified XML structure back to the XML file.
  It overwrites the existing XML file with the updated XML data.
